	  <h2 class="_1">15+ tricks for</h2><h2 class="_2">Apple Watch</h2>
    </div> 
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>1. Wake to your last-used app</h1>
    	<img src="photos/1.jpg">
    	<p>By default, when you flick your wrist, Apple Watch will wake and show the time. If you'd instead rather it go back to whatever you were doing before it going to sleep, you can change that setting by going to <strong>Settings > General > Wake Screen.</strong><br>

        From here, scroll down to the section On Screen Raise Show Last. Choices include While in Sessions, Within 2 Minutes of Last Use, Within 1 Hour of Last Use, and Always.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="tip">
    	<h1>2. Make the on-screen text larger</h1>
    	<img src="photos/2.jpg">
    	<p>With such a tiny device, sometimes you want the option for bigger text at your disposal. Apple makes this easy in its accessibility settings; to change the text on your Watch, go to <strong>Settings > Brightness & Text Size</strong>, and adjust to your liking.

        You can also choose a specialty Big Text watch face if all you're interested in is seeing the time in large numerals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>3. Hide watch apps</h1>
    	<img src="photos/3.jpg">
    	<p>To hide third-party apps from showing up on your Apple Watch, go into the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and make sure you're in the My Watch section. Scroll down to the section called Installed on Apple Watch. Tap the apps you'd like to delete by toggling to the off position. Even though you've removed their Watch interfaces, those apps will remain installed on your iPhone unless you delete them from that device, as well.
    	</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>4. Find your iPhone with your Watch</h1>
    	<img src="photos/4.jpg">
    	<p>Can't find your iPhone? Don't sweat it — the Apple Watch can help you track it down. From your Watch face, swipe up to activate Control Center. From here, tap the Ping iPhone button in blue to have it make a noise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>5. Quickly access Zoom and VoiceOver</h1>
    	<img src="photos/5.jpg">
    	<p>Want Zoom or VoiceOver to be quickly available on your Watch? You can turn on the triple-click Accessibility shortcut to automatically activate either Zoom mode or VoiceOver. To do so, visit the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, then go to <strong>My Watch > General > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut.</strong> From here, you can choose which you'd like to activate on triple-click automatically.<br>
        <span class="siri">Siri can also turn VoiceOver on or off with a verbal command — ask your Watch.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>6. Save custom watch faces</h1>
    	<img src="photos/6.jpg">
    	<p>Not only can you customize Apple's default Watch faces by using Force Touch on the Watch display, but you can also save customized faces for future use. To do so, Force Touch on the Watch display once more, then swipe all the way to the left and tap the <strong>New button.</strong> From there, you can customize the new version of your watch face to your liking.<br>
        <span class="siri">To delete a custom watch face, swipe up.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>7. Set your watch five minutes fast</h1>
    	<img src="photos/7.jpg">
    	<p>Like being early for your appointments? You can manually set the watch face to display five minutes fast — it won't affect your alarms, notifications, or clocks from other countries, but it'll show on the Watch face. To do this, go to <strong>Settings > Time > +0 min,</strong> then turn the Digital crown to advance the time ahead up to 59 minutes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>8. Turn off snooze for your alarms</h1>
    	<img src="photos/8.jpg">
    	<p>Don't trust yourself to wake up on time? You can disable the Snooze button on Apple Watch by going into the Alarm app on the device and tapping on the alarm time you'd like to change. Toggle so snooze isn't an option.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>9. Pre-compose custom Messages responses</h1>
    	<img src="photos/9.jpg">
    	<p>You can't type directly on your Apple Watch, but you can set up a few pre-composed responses via your iPhone that you can tap on during conversations to auto-send. To do so, visit the Apple Watch app, then go to <strong>
        <br>My Watch > Messages > Default Replies.</strong><br> You can change this list and add/remove pre-composed responses at any time.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="tip">
    	<h1>10. Share your location in Messages with Force Touch</h1>
    	<img src="photos/10.jpg">
    	<p>Want to send your friend your current location while you're out and about? From your Messages conversation, Force Touch the display and tap <strong>Send Location.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <h1>11. Choose what mailboxes show up on your Watch</h1>
        <img src="photos/11.jpg">
        <p>Don't want to be inundated with notifications and info from all your mailboxes? You can choose specific mailboxes to show up on the Watch from the iPhone app. Just go to <strong>My Watch > Mail > Include Mail.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <h1>12. Send your favorite watch face</h1>
        <img src="photos/12.jpg">
        <p>Beginning with watchOS 7, you can send your watch faces to a friend. Force Touch on the Watch display, then select the face you wish to share. Tap the New Message icon to send your face.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <h1>13. SOS Function</h1>
        <img src="photos/13.png" class="img">
        <p>How to make a call: <strong>Press and hold the side button</strong> on your Apple Watch until the <strong>SOS</strong> alarm slider appears. Continue to hold down the side button. Wait for the countdown to start and the signal sounds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <h1>14. Build your leaving time into your Calendar alerts</h1>
        <img src="photos/14.jpeg" class="crrr">
        <p>If there's a location added to your event, you can create an alert to tell you when to leave that factors in driving or walking distance along with traffic. To do so, make sure the individual event has the Travel Time switch enabled; you can do this on your iPhone by going to the Calendar app, tapping the event in question, and going to <strong>Edit > Travel Time.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <h1>15. Flag Mail messages with Force Touch</h1>
        <img src="photos/15.jpeg">
        <p>There's no way to compose a new email on the Watch owing to its relative impracticability as an email machine, but you can flag messages you want to reply to later with ease. Just Force Touch on a mail message, then tap  <strong>Flag.</strong></p>
