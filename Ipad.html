    	<h1>1. Turn the iPad keyboard into a trackpad</h1>
    	<img src="images/1.jpg">
    	<p>The iPad currently doesn’t support wired or Bluetooth mice, but to Apple’s credit, it has a cool (if limited) substitute. Whenever the digital keyboard is visible, put two fingers on the keyboard at once and move them around.<br>
    	The keyboard’s keys will vanish, allowing you to move a cursor around the display as though you were using a MacBook trackpad. It’s great for selecting big blocks of text.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>2. Put all your important apps on the dock</h1>
    	<img src="images/2.jpg" class="img">
    	<p>
		To add an app or folder to the dock, press down on its icon on the home screen until it starts to wobble. Then drag it down to the dock and plop it into place. That’s all there is to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>3. Split the keyboard in half for easier typing</h1>
    	<img src="images/3.jpg" class="img2">
    	<p>
		When the digital keyboard is visible, press down on the keyboard button in the lower right. Press Split in the menu that pops up, and the keyboard will <strong>split.</strong> If the keyboard is in the way, quickly press the keyboard button and then slide the keyboard up or down. Don’t press down for too long, though, or the <strong>Split</strong> menu will pop up again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>4. Use the Files app for better organization</h1>
    	<img src="images/4.jpg" class="img2">
    	<p>
		At the most basic, you’ll use two tabs. Recent lets you see all the documents you’ve recently used, and you can open them from there. Browse lets you see the doc folders for individual apps, and you make made additional folders for further organization. (I especially like to do this for PDFs and similar docs.) It’s all tied to iCloud, too, so you can access your Desktop and Documents folder from your Mac.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>5. Search for anything with the Spotlight tool</h1>
    	<img src="images/5.jpg">
    	<p>
		To access Spotlight on your iPad, swipe down in the middle of the home screen once you’ve unlocked your tablet and then enter your query in the Search bar at the top. You’ll see results from your Files app, your emails, individual apps, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
    	<h1>6. Open recent documents by pressing the app icon</h1>
    	<img src="images/6.jpg">
    	<p>
		This takes some practice. If you press for too long—around two seconds—the iPad thinks you’re trying to move or delete the app. The feature also doesn’t work with all apps, so there’s some trial and error involved. Notability and iA Writer support it, for example, but oddly enough, Apple’s own Notes app does not.</p>

    		<ol>
    			<li>Turn on your Bluetooth accessory and place it near your iPad.</li>

    	<h1>8. Use multiple apps at once and work between them.</h1>
    	<img src="images/8.jpg" class="_3">
    	<p>iPad makes multitasking easy and intuitive. Work seamlessly across apps. Use Slide Over or Split View to work with multiple apps at the same time, and even drag and drop content between apps with touch or a trackpad.</p>

    	<h1>9. Produce music or record a podcast with GarageBand.</h1>
    	<img src="images/9.jpg" class="_3">
    	<p>Audio apps for iPad help you learn, practice, record, and create with ease. So release an album, start a podcast, or plug in an instrument and jam with your iPad.</p>

    	<h1>15. Copy items from your iPhone to your iPad</h1>
    	<img src="images/15.jpg" class="_3">
    	<p>Sometimes you’ll find an image snippet of text on your iPhone that you‘ll want to use with an app that’s only available on your iPad. Apple makes this easy, so long as you’re on the same iCloud account, the same Wi-Fi-network, and Bluetooth is enabled.

		On your iPhone, copy the text or photo as you normally would. On your iPad, open the document where you want to paste it, hold down your finger until the menu appears, press Paste, and then It should appear.</p>
