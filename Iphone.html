       	<p>One of the biggest advantages of iOS over Android is that your iPhone seamlessly pairs with other Apple devices, including the MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. If you want to be able to answer a call or reply to a text message from your laptop, here’s what you do:</p>

             <img src="assets/img/3.png"></a>
       	<p>Hidden within your phone settings is the option to erase all data on your phone after 10 failed passcode attempts. Although this potential for data loss may sound scary, it’s highly unlikely a significant other or child would accidentally erase all your data. The reason being because after the fifth failed password attempt, iOS requires a 1-minute timeout before you can try typing a password in again. After the sixth try, you get a 5-minute timeout. After the seventh, 15 minutes, and so on and so forth.

This means it would take more than 3 hours to enter 10 incorrect passcodes. The only person spending that much time probably has bad intentions, meaning you’ll want your personal data to be erased. Here’s how to turn the setting on.ss</p>

       	<p>Apple has added a new option to its Battery Health feature called "Optimized Battery Charging," which is designed to extend the total battery life of a device running iOS 13. Apple says the feature slows the rate of battery aging by reducing the time your iPhone spends fully charged. The tool uses machine learning to understand your daily charging routine, so it can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use your phone. That way if you charge your phone at night, it won’t hold a 100% charge for several hours, which degrades your battery.</p>

Safari makes it much easier to track flights, so you know what time your friend will land and if their flight experiences any delays. If you're the one flying, it comes in handy for figuring out what gate you need to go to and informing you of the total duration of your flight (that way you know how many episodes of Twin Peaks you need to download, of course).

       	<p>Apple hopes to prevent accidents and cut down on distractions while driving with this new feature. It blocks incoming calls, texts, and notifications when your iPhone detects acceleration or connects to your vehicle's Bluetooth. When someone tries to get a hold of you, your iPhone will send an auto-reply message to let the person know you're driving. The feature can be disabled for passengers, and if there's an emergency and someone needs to reach you, they can still contact you if they respond to the text message with the word "urgent." To turn on the settings, just do the following:

</ul>	
<ul>
Tap Auto-Reply to customize and change the message, if you wish
